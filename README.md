# Graphical Connect4 Game with Artificial Intelligence

## Description:
This is a graphical game developed in Python using the PyGame library.
<br> It follows the rules of the classic Connect4 game and implements a handmade Artificial Intelligence with adaptive difficulties.
<br> This AI uses Mini-max with alpha-beta prunings in order to calculate the most efficient moves. The difficulties are dependent on the exploration's depth.

## Instructions:
- Make sure to have the following libraries installed: numpy, pygame, soundfile
- Run the game from the terminal: python3 Puissance4.py

## Recommendations:
- Soundfile is not working on macOS, therefore, we cannot play musics/sounds and a different version of the game must be installed: **please download the game from the branch "without-music-for-mac"**
